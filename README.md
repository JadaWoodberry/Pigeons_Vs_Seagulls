# Pigeons_Vs_Seagulls

## Story

There are two gangs in the streets of San Francisco: The Noble Street Chickens (Pigeons) and Destructive Beach Chickens (Seagulls).Two pigeons called Scruffie and Scrapie go to Speedos in search for a duck named Sunburn whom they believe can help them resolve an incoming turf war before anything too nasty happens. The Seagulls are fed up with the Pigeons ruling the streets and seek more power. There’s not much they can rule over at the ocean anyway. But there’s a problem: the Pigeons won’t give up anything without a fight, and Seagulls are known to play dirty. The fight will be held at CityView High School, mascot of the seagull, where they have the advantage. Time is scarce and the stakes are high.  Luckily, Sunburn knows the perfect person to help! Will Sunburn succeed? Will The Beach Chickens take over the Street Chicken turf forever? Or will both sides suffer fatal loses?
